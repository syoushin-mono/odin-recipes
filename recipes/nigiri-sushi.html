        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Nigiri sushi is that familiar style of sushi made up of an oval shaped mound
            of rice with a splice of (usually) raw fish on top.  The word nigiri comes from
            the Japanese <em>nigirizushi</em>, which translates as "hand-pressed sushi."
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus nigiri is a type of sushi where the rice is molded by hand and the fish
            or other topping pressed by hand atop the rice. And the stickiness of the rice,
            combined with the moisture of the topping, that helps adhere the strip of raw fish
            to the mound of rice underneath.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, 
                cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 
                20 to 25 minutes. Transfer rice to a bowl and cut in rice vinegar 
                using a rice paddle or wooden spoon. Season with 1 teaspoon sugar and 1 teaspoon salt, 
                or to taste. Allow to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.
            </li>

                Prepare fish for wrapping by slicing against the grain into thin pieces 
                about 2 inches long and 1 inch wide. Refrigerate until ready to use.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk eggs, 1/2 teaspoon sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a bowl. Pour about 
                1/4 of the mixture in a thin layer in a large greased skillet over medium heat. 
                Cook without stirring until cooked through, about 2 to 3 minutes. Roll into a log and 
                set in one side of the pan. Repeat with 1/4 of the egg mixture, rolling each log 
                into a new log, to create one large log. Slice omelet on the diagonal into pieces 
                about 1/2-inch thick.
            </li>

                Place a piece of fish or shrimp in your hand and smear it lightly with 
                wasabi paste if desired. Grab 1 to 2 tablespoons of rice and roll it into a 
                small nugget in your hand. Place the rice ball on top of the fish or shrimp, 
                squeezing gently to make it adhere. Set aside while you assemble the remaining 
                pieces of fish and shrimp.

                Take a slice of egg omelet in your hand, grab 1 to 2 tablespoons of rice, and 
                roll it into a small nugget in your hand. Place the rice ball on top of the egg, 
                squeezing gently to make it adhere.

                Wrap a strip of nori around each package; moisten one end of the 
                nori strip and seal to join.
