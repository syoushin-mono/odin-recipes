        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1/3 cup butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. 
                Beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter in a separate bowl. 
                Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. 
                You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until 
                it's just blended together. The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for 
                each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip 
                with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve hot and enjoy!
